# vue-beginner
A sandbox for all my vue learnings

This is a way for me to manage my codebase across multiple devices and work environments. 
I have recently picked up Vue as I feel my front end knowledge in areas such as HTML,CSS/SASS and JavaScript have been steadily improving over the past year. 


What I have learned thus far is that Vue has great documention for beginners as well as a tonne of dedicated resources. 
Vue adds structure and utilities to the front end so the app is easier to extend as it grows. 
The Vue app attaches itself to a single DOM element then fully controls it. 
Directives are special tokesn in the markup, previxed with v-, that tell the library to do something to the DOM element. 



I will be working through the "The Net Ninjas" Vue crash course on YT and will add a new repo when beginning vue-cli.
